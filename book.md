# Preface

## About this book

A primary role of a HSM is the secure management of digital keys. This book introduces digital key
management concepts and reinforces those concepts with exercises that the reader can perform on an open
source Thales HSM Simulator.

The reader should have a basic understanding of symmetric and asymmetric cryptography. Appendix A,
Introductory Books in Cryptography provides a list of introductory books in cryptography for those
wishing to learn the basics or just wanting to refresh their knowledge in the field of cryptography.

## Audience

Undergraduate and graduate students should find that this book supplements their studies in the theoretical
concepts of cryptography with practical applications.

Software Engineers and Architects designing and building security solutions using the Thales brand of
HSM will learn concepts and patterns of key management that can be applied to their designs
